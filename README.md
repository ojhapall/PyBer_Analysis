# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of the assignment was to analyze the trends of ride sharing by each city type (Urban, Rural, Suburban). The trend was shown weekly from Jan 01, 2019 to Apr 29, 2019. 

##Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The graph shows that there is a peak at the end of february for all city types. 

The graph also shows that drivers in Urban cities collect more fares than drivers in Rural cities. 

##Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the performance of all cities, during the end of february, increasing the driver count may also increase the total Fares. Secondly, the data shows that drivers in Urban cities perform much better so there should also be an increase in the driver count for Urban cities. Finally, it seems as though the Suburban cities will be hitting another peak during May so the driver county there should increase. The decline in rural should result in a decrease driver count to compensate for the increase in traffic. 

It may be beneficial to do a further analysis to see if Fares increase due to longer routes or an increased number of rideshares.
